# Maintenance And Portability

Use this file when maintaining `AGENTS.md` over time, keeping multi-tool setups coherent, or deciding when the file should change.

## Maintain one source of truth

If the repo serves multiple coding-agent tools, keep `AGENTS.md` as the canonical instruction file whenever the toolchain supports it.

Why:

- one authoritative file is easier to audit
- drift between `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and other mirrors is expensive and confusing
- path-local scoping is more manageable when one hierarchy owns the truth

If mirrors are still needed for tool compatibility:

- generate or symlink them from `AGENTS.md`
- treat manual divergence as a bug
- document the mirroring rule in the repo's contributing or agent docs, not inside every local file

## Self-improving AGENTS loop

A good `AGENTS.md` evolves by encoding real observed failures, not by preemptively dumping every possible rule.

Healthy loop:

1. Observe a repeated agent mistake.
2. Ask what durable truth would have prevented it.
3. Add the smallest instruction that prevents the failure.
4. Re-run the relevant checks and confirm the new rule actually helps.
5. Delete or tighten stale rules when the repo or tooling changes.

This keeps the file empirical instead of speculative.

## When to update the file

Update `AGENTS.md` when:

- the verify commands changed
- the repo added a new dangerous workflow or approval boundary
- a local subtree now needs its own commands or red lines
- the docs map or skill triggers changed materially
- a repeated mistake keeps happening because the agent lacks repo-specific context

Do not update it just because:

- the team has a new philosophy slogan
- you want to summarize recent work
- a one-off incident happened but does not imply a durable repo rule
- you can point to an existing doc instead

## Validation loop

When authoring or editing:

1. Verify the commands are current.
2. Confirm the file's rules match the owning directory and workflow.
3. Check that deeper docs or local files still exist at the named paths.
4. Read the file top-to-bottom and remove anything inferable or repetitive.
5. If the file names required checks, run them after editing whenever feasible.

When auditing:

- distinguish stale commands from stale scope
- distinguish missing commands from missing docs routing
- distinguish too much content from missing content

## Portability across coding-agent tools

Portable instruction design tends to share these properties:

- short, literal headings
- exact commands and paths
- no vendor-specific magic unless clearly labeled
- scope defined by directory structure, not by brand-specific features alone

Safe portable patterns:

- root plus path-local files
- exact command sections
- compact docs maps
- explicit red lines and ask-first rules

Less portable patterns:

- tool-specific slash commands without fallback explanation
- assumptions about a single agent's hidden system prompt
- long sections describing UI behavior instead of repo behavior

If the file includes vendor-specific notes, keep them small and isolate them near the bottom or under a clear heading.
